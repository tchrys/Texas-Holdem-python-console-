# Texas-Holdem-python-console-

This is a texas holdem game you can play on python console. The number of players are set in game.py. At each player turn,
cards on his hand and cards on the table are displayed as .jpg files. All mechanics are implemented(inclusively a hand comparator
to decide who is the winner - in hands.py), but I haven't made a bot yet.
