# Texas-Holdem-python-console-

This is a texas holdem game you can play on python console. The number of players can be set in game.py. At each player turn,
cards on his hand and cards on the table are displayed as .jpg files. It will be also displayed a message telling the player
to enter a number which represents his bet. 0 represents fold or check depending that situation. If the number is invalid the player
must enter another bet(for instance if he has to call 50, a number greater than 0 and less than 50 is invalid)

  All mechanics are implemented(inclusively a hand comparator to decide who is the winner and what a player has - in hands.py), but this game is rather not useful since I haven't made a bot yet.
